# MapScramblerPython

This was written with the [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw/) project in mind.

This is a small tool to randomize the map list found in the server settings
file. This was very annoying for me to do by hand as it could take upwards of
10 minutes each time. Plutonium does not support automatic map list scrambling
so I made it myself.

Before using, please ensure that you have a map list that is in the proper
format. There are properly formatted lists in this repository that you can use
as templates.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or greater

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description | Example |
| - | - | - | - |
| `MapFile` | :heavy_check_mark: | Path to the map file. Can be relative. Goes right after script file name. | ```python scrambler.py /c/gameserver/maps.txt -l -p "mp "```, ```python scrambler.py "C:\gameserver\maps.txt" -l -p "map "``` |
| `--ServerFile`   | :x: | Path to server.cfg file. Can be relative. | `--ServerFile /c/gameserver/server.cfg`, `--ServerFile "C:\gameserver\server.cfg"` |
| `--PreArg`       | :x: | Arguments that go before the map list. Note that spaces or new lines at the end will not be added by the script, so they must be present in the string given.                                                                                            | ```--PreArg "set sv_hostname \"Game Server\" set g_gametype \"war\" set sv_maprotation "```|
| `--PostArg` | :x: | Arguments that go after the map list. Note that spaces or new lines at the beginning will not be added by the script, so they must be present in the string given.| See `--PreArg` example.|
| `--ArgSliceChar` | :x: | An alternative to `--PreArg` and `--PostArg`, place a character in your server.cfg file directly before and after the map list. This **CANNOT** be used with `--PreArg` **OR** `--PostArg`| `--ArgSliceChar "$"`|
| `OutputDir` | :x:| Path to the desired output directory. ||
| `OutputFile` | :x: | Path to desired output file if different from default: `./out/maps.txt`||
| `--Three`| :x: | Enables map list filtering for Modern Warfare 3. **ðŸ›‘ WARNING ðŸ›‘** This command should only be used with the configured MW3 map file found in the repository or one configured like it. ||
| `--MapTypes`| :x: | To be used with `--Thee`. Specifies map categories to filter out of scrambler.<ul><li> `v` Vanilla Maps</li><li>`s` 1v1/2v2/3v3 Sized Maps(Rust not included)</li><li>`d` Non-short DLC maps</li><li>`p` Plutonium Maps</li> ||
| `-l`, `--list`   | :x: | Specifies if you want it output to a list file instead of to your sever.cfg file. Not to be used with `--ServerFile`. Can be used with `--Prefix` and `--PostFix` if desired. Will ignore `--ArgSliceChar` if it is present. **Option is on by default** ||
| `-o`, `--override`   | :x: | Overrides the original server.cfg with the new one. Only use this if you know what you are doing. ||
| `-p`, `--prefix` | :x: | Prefix for map names if the game requires it(e.g. mp [map name]). Spaces will not be added to the end of this string.| `-p "mp "`|
| `-q`, `--quotes` | :x: | Encapsulates the map list in quotes.||
