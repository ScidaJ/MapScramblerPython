# MW2MapScramblerPython

This was written with the [IW4x](https://xlabs.dev/) project in mind. It is a small tool to randomize the map list found in the server settings file. This was very annoying for me to do by hand as it could take upwards of 10 minutes each time. IW4x does not support automatic map list scrambling so I made it myself.

## Arguments

| Argument | Required     | Description                            | Example               |
| -------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| MapFile  | :heavy_check_mark: | Path to the map file. Can be relative. | /c/MW2Server/maps.txt |
